Semantic HTML tags are **meaningful tags** that describe the purpose of the content inside them â€” both to the **browser** and to **developers** (and also screen readers for accessibility).

```html
<header> for top section (logo, nav, intro)
<nav> for nav menu with nav-links
<main> for main content of the doc
<section> sections of content 
<article> for blog post, news article
<aside> sidebar content, i.e. not related to main content
<footer> bottom section with links and copyright license
<figure> to wrap media images, diagrams, charts with captions
<figcaption> caption for figure
<mark> highlight text with yellow
<time> represent datetime="" attribute for machine readability  
```

also a new semantic tag added <address /> which is used to wrap personal social media address like email, linkedin, etc and **NOT** the actual postal address.

```html
