Hyprland is not just a windows manager, which controls how windows are arranged and behave but it is a compositor. It actually renders the window onto the screen. 

> It manages shadows, visual effects, transparency rounded corners, shortcuts and all.
> It is lightweight than other window managers as it doesn't have any bloatware or unnecessary daemon services running in background.
> It is usually faster than others as it has WM and compositor integrated unlike others which uses different services for both.
